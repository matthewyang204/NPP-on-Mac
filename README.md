Notepad++ for macs

Note:
After unzipping the app and dragging it to /Applications, run 
```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Notepad++.app
```
in the terminal because since this app is not Apple-signed, it is quarantined. This command bypasses the quarantine, taking the app out of the quarantine.

To update:

Click the question mark menu button

Click the Update Notepad++ button in the menu that pops up

Follow the on-screen instructions to update Notepad++ (requires relaunch of the app)
